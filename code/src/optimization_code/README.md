# CausalBayesianOptimization
Code for the Causal Bayesian Optimization algorithm (http://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/aglietti20a/aglietti20a.pdf)

# Usage
The code to run the CBO algorthm is in `runCBO.py`. The file `runBO.py` can be used to run the non causal version of BO which is used as a benchmark in the paper. It is possible to change the causal graph that by changing the value of the variables 'experiment'. The results are saved in the folder `Data/` when running the experiments. The folder `Data/` contains the observational and intervational data used to produce the results in the paper.
